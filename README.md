# The Duck's School
Welcome to The Duck’s School App, Which help students to choose their ideal course based on many approaches.
In the Duck’s School, we use information about subjects that students have studied and other students' subjects by employing the Recommended Systems approach, as well as the non-Personalized approach by visualizing different attributes of courses to students to assist them compare between the courses. The Ducks' School is user-friendly for students in all disciplines, not just IT.
The Duck’s School was developed as part of a Learning Analytics lecture project at Duisburg – Essen University.

# Dataset Description
For this project we created our own dataset based on infromations collected from the [Open University Learning Analytics Dataset
](https://analyse.kmi.open.ac.uk/open_dataset#about).From 2013 to 2014, the dataset contains information about students, courses, and their activities.
These informations are:
* Lecture name
* Lecture pass rate
* Students'informations,such as age, gender, region and so on
* Scores
* Previous attempts


Needed libraries:

```ruby
* pymongo
* Pandas
```
